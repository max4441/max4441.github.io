        <p class="w2q1">
            What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting
            with the experience?
        </p>
        <p class="w2q1a">
          I was captivated by how smooth the animation of the janitor was as I
          was scrolling through the website.
        </p>
        <p class="w2q2">
            Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of
            your discrete actions.
        </p>
        <p class="w2q2a">
          <span class="text-wrapper-3"
            >- Constant Scrolling<br />- Occasional clicking of interactive
            elements<br />- reading the articles<br />- taking note on the
            animate aspects of the visual elements 
        </p>
        <p class="w2q3">
          What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
        </p>
        <p class="w2q3a">Mostly just scrolling through the webpage.</p>
        <p class="w2q4">
          What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with
          the experience?
        </p>
        <p class="w2q4a">
          Just Scrolling.
        </p>
        <p class="w2q5">
          What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the
          interactive experience?
        </p>
        <p class="w2q5a">
          The constant scrolling of the website creates a parallax flow in the
          structure, thus blending the animation together.
        </p>
        <p class="w2q6">
          How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
        </p>
        <p class="w2q6a">
          This is effective at conveying a storyline/timeline flow without the
          user getting bored.
        </p>
        <p class="w2q7">
          What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted
          with over time? (For how long and how many different times)
        </p>
        <p class="w2q7a">
          The experience does not require a long time and only requires 1-2
          times to finish.
        </p>
        <p class="w2q8">
          How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
          interacted with over time?
        </p>
        <p class="w2q8a">
          The experience is very simple as it’s only interaction is scrolling
          through the webpage and reading its contents.
        </p>
        <div class="blackbg2">
          <div class="week3qna">WEEK 3 QnA</div>
          <p class="w3q1">
            What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
            reference?
          </p>
          <p class="w3q1a">
            The experience references physical media forms such as newspapers
            and journal articles. The content is laid out in a vertical format
            similar to reading an article in real-life. They have also added
            snippets of newspapers to reference this form of traditional media.
          </p>
          <p class="w3q2">
            What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
            act when engaging with your research experience?
          </p>
          <p class="w3q2a">
            That we should slow down and take our time while reading through the
            contents of the website. As newspapers are usually mostly text and
            contain a lot of information, we should focus and digest the written
            information as well.
          </p>
          <p class="w3q3">
            What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
            feel when engaging with your research experience?
          </p>
          <p class="w3q3a">
            I feel well-informed about the content of the website as it is
            concise and straight to the point.
          </p>
          <p class="w3q4">
            What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what
            makes that part frustrating?​​
          </p>
          <p class="w3q4a">
            The lack of interactivity in the website. The website could have
            added in more interactive elements such as a newspaper flip or
            playing around with the trash on the website.
          </p>
          <p class="w3q5">
            What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what
            makes that part satisfying?
          </p>
          <p class="w3q5a">
            The most satisfying part was how smooth the animations of the visual
            elements were moving as I was scrolling through the webpage. It is
            satisfying as it creates a seamless transition between the various
            content within the pages.
