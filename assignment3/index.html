    <!-- The music that i chose plays a big role in conveying the words seen. 'calm' is accompanied with 
    The Flower Duet by Lakme, which is royalty-free as it is classical music from before the 1920s.
    The techno track is produced by me, which accompanies 'chaotic' when mouse-hover on. -->

    <!-- Eventhough the website is a comical one, i wanted to help spread awareness of the importance of 
    mental health. I have added a link at the bottom of the page that directs the user to the 
    australian mental health website through a new tab. -->
